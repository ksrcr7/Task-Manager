# Task-Manager
A small clean C++ console app to manage tasks (add/list/done/remove)with **file persistence**.
This project is a follow-up to my Fraction Calculator to practice:
- STL containers
- File I/O (persistence with simple text/CSV)
- OOP design and error handling
- Clean, testable structure

## Build (placeholder)
Instructions will be added as the project evolves.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Basic CLI (add, list, done, remove)
- [ ] Load/Save from file
- [ ] Input validation & error handling
- [ ] Simple tests (assert or a lightweight framework)
